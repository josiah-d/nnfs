For the second session on "Coding Our First Neurons," you want to engage participants in a way that encourages discussion,
reflection, and deeper understanding. Here are some questions that can help stimulate conversation and interaction without feeling like a quiz:

A Single Neuron

    How would you explain the concept of a single neuron to someone who is new to neural networks?
        Follow-up: Can you think of an analogy that might make this explanation clearer?

    What is the significance of the weights and biases in a neuron? How do they influence the neuron's output?

A Layer of Neurons

    Why do we need multiple neurons arranged in layers rather than a single neuron?
        Follow-up: How does a layer of neurons increase the modelâ€™s capability to capture complex patterns?

    What challenges might arise when scaling from a single neuron to a full layer of neurons?

Tensors, Arrays, and Vectors

    How do tensors, arrays, and vectors differ from one another, and why are these distinctions important in the context of neural networks?
        Follow-up: Can you give an example of when you would use each one?

    What advantages do you see in using NumPy for handling tensors, arrays, and vectors?

Dot Product and Vector Addition

    Can someone describe the dot product and its role in neural network computations?
        Follow-up: How does vector addition fit into this process?

    Why is understanding these basic operations crucial for building and understanding neural networks?

A Single Neuron with NumPy

    What did you find most challenging when implementing a single neuron with NumPy?
        Follow-up: How did you overcome this challenge?

    How does implementing a neuron with NumPy help in understanding the underlying mechanics of neural networks?

A Layer of Neurons with NumPy

    What are the key differences between implementing a single neuron and a layer of neurons with NumPy?
        Follow-up: What additional considerations need to be taken into account?

    What benefits do you see in coding these implementations from scratch rather than using pre-built functions?

A Batch of Data

    Why is it important to process data in batches rather than one example at a time?
        Follow-up: What impact does batch processing have on training efficiency and model performance?

    What are some potential challenges you might face when handling batches of data?

Matrix Product

    Can someone explain how matrix products are used in the context of neural networks?
        Follow-up: Why is this operation particularly important when working with layers of neurons?

    What are the benefits and potential pitfalls of using matrix products in neural network computations?

Transposition for the Matrix Product

    Why is transposition necessary for certain matrix operations in neural networks?
        Follow-up: Can you give an example of when you might need to transpose a matrix?

    What insights did you gain from implementing matrix transposition in NumPy?

A Layer of Neurons & Batch of Data w/ NumPy

    What were the main challenges you encountered when combining a layer of neurons with a batch of data using NumPy?
        Follow-up: How did you address these challenges?

    How does working with batches of data and layers of neurons in NumPy enhance your understanding of more complex neural network architectures?

Engaging Discussions

    What surprised you the most about the coding exercises in this chapter?
        Follow-up: How did these exercises change or reinforce your understanding of neural networks?

    What practical tips or best practices did you discover while coding neurons and layers from scratch?
        Follow-up: How can these tips be applied to more advanced neural network projects?

    How do you think the concepts covered in this session will be built upon in later chapters of the book?
        Follow-up: What are you most looking forward to learning next?

By using these questions, you can encourage participants to reflect on their learning, share their experiences, and engage in meaningful discussions that enhance their understanding of neural networks.
